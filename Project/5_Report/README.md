Introduction
---------------------------------------
The system that is anticipated to be built consists of a 6 DIGIT clock including hour, minute and second using a very cheap devices that covers a very favorable place. The design consists of all the features that a digital clock should consist and as the design is synchronous the overall delay is negligible.

ALARM
--------------------------------
Consider a modern digital alarm clock. It is an example of where an embedded system is commonly used. The alarm clock is mass-produced. To keep costs low, an integrated circuit
(I/C) is designed for it.

LCD Display
-------------------------------------------
Before wiring the LCD screen to your Arduino board we suggest to solder a pin header strip to the 14 (or 16) pin count connector of the LCD screen, as you can see in the image further up. To wire your LCD screen to your board, connect the following pins: LCD RS pin to digital pin 12. LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11.

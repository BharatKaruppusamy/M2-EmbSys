Introduction
---------------------------------------
The system that is anticipated to be built consists of a 6 DIGIT clock including hour, minute and second using a very cheap devices that covers a very favorable place. The design consists of all the features that a digital clock should consist and as the design is synchronous the overall delay is negligible.

ALARM
--------------------------------
Consider a modern digital alarm clock. It is an example of where an embedded system is commonly used. The alarm clock is mass-produced. To keep costs low, an integrated circuit
(I/C) is designed for it.
